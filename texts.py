ending_text = """This is the end of the journey back in time!

I hope it was warm rewalking these 7 years we walked together.
I certainly found it heart-warming going back in time.

What I wanted to say is, although we may feel stuck at times, and life could feel
frustrating as it is, there has always been coutless happy moments in our lives.
Even in the past 3 years when we can't travel, and Hong Kong sucks with every passing day.
And look how far you have come, how far we have come! 

You have actually accomplished a lot in these 30 years.

You may feel that some richer kid's life is better, but the truth is, everyone has sad moments, as well as happy moments.
But if you look closely enought, what hasn't changed over the years is your hearty smile, that has never changed.
This is in your nature, this is what makes you you, and this is what I love about you.

I hope you treasure this gift god gave you, no matter what age you are. 
Because age is just a number, and in the heart, you are always 18.
